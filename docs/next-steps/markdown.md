# Markdown

Here's a few tips that work everywhere we support the Markdown syntax, e.g. pages, tutorials, the project description...

## Displaying and Resizing Embedded Images

You can upload images to Panoptes and display them anywhere the Project Builder allows markdown. Tutorials, help, the field guide, and even as icons. Hereâ€™s Galaxy Zoo adding icons to each answer using transparent .png images:

But what if your image is stupidly large to use as an icon, or much too small for the field guide?

Panoptes has a special version of markdown that lets you specify the image dimensions to display. Copy the markdown string from the Media tab, then add ={pixel_width}x{pixel_height, or blank for square} just before the last bracket. For example:

`![image.png](https://panoptes-uploads...748eb.png =60x)` 

will display a square image resized to 60 by 60 pixels.

This works for an image you host yourself (see [Hosting your own subject media](hosting-your-own-subject-media.md)) - just update the URL.
